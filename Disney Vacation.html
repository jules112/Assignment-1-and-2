<h1>Our Vacation</h1>
<p>
Earlier this year, my family and I went on a Disney cruise to the Bahamas. It was so much fun!
</p>
<p> 
There were many things to do on and off the ship. On the ship, we liked to swim in the pools on deck. The ship had 2 swimming pools, water slides, and a splash pad. We also liked to watch the plays and movies. Off the ship, we liked exploring the island. We swam in the crystal blue waters, and collected sea shells along the white sandy beaches. We also went snorkeling, and saw beautiful fish. 
</p>
<p>
Every night we ate in a different themed restaurant. The first night we at seafood in King Triton's Palace. On the second night, we ate in Tiana's Place with cajun food. The third night was Parot Cay with a tropical, Carribean, theme. Our last night, we at Animator's Palate, which was a restaurant that showed you how the cartoon movies were made.

<h2>Disney Characters</h2>

There were Disney characters running around the ship all day long. We even saw characters on the island. We saw Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, of course. We also saw a lot of their friends, such as Goofy, Pluto, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, and many more. My family enjoyed getting to meet them.

<p>
The characters my family really enjoyed meeting, you actually had to have an appointment to see. Before we got on the cruise, we had to make reserve our spots to meet Princess Anna and Princess Elsa. We also had to reserve a time to meet Princess Tiana, Cinderella, Belle, and Ariel. That was probably one of the highlights of the trip.
